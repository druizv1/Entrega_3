Code explanation:

The C function ejemplo is annotated using ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) and verified using Frama-C's WP plugin.

Function: void ejemplo(int i, int j)
This function takes two integers i and j, performs basic arithmetic operations on them, and asserts that their product after modification is equal to 6. The logic follows these steps:

Precondition (requires):
Requires that both i and j are initially 0:
requires i ≡ 0 ∧ j ≡ 0;

Postcondition (ensures):
Ensures that the product of the original values of i and j is 6:
ensures \old(i) * \old(j) ≡ 6;

Overflow Checks (assert rte):
The code includes runtime checks to ensure that adding values to i and j doesn't exceed 2147483647 (32-bit signed int max).

Assignments:
The function does not change any memory:
assigns \nothing;

Exit Behavior:
The function always terminates without throwing exceptions:
exits \false; and terminates \true;
